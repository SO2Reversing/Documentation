It looks like the "Scene" files have the header 03000000

looking at file 3207 - uses renas bedroom as the BG - maybe this is the debug room

its comprised of a header, then multiple SLZ files  
Some of these files are the actual BG IMG  
E.G. the files split at address 0xEAE8 and 0x0430  
There is another file that *seems* to hold animation and sprite data which is at the address 0x017C24  
Then there is another file that seems to hold the glyph information 0x016870
