# Overview 

File 4489 contains Item titles, descriptions and the 3D Models used in the inventory UI menu.  

All items are in this file.  

There are 1024 items.  

Each item entry in this file has 2 SLZ files.  

The first slz contains the items title and description.  
The second slz contains the 3d model.  


## Title and Description File  

The file contains a 16 byte header.  

the first 4 bytes are possibly file type  
the next 4 bytes are the offset to the item description glyph indexes  
the next 4 bytes are the offset to the item description glyph details  
the next 4 bytes are the file size  
The last 4 bytes are the Item Title image diamensions  
2 bytes for width then 2 bytes for height (16bit width height)  
  
  
Image data is stored as 4bit pixels.  

The item description is then stored after the title image.
The item description is not stored in a string format. It is stored as a series of bitmap glyphs.

The first section of the item description stored the indexes into the glyphs.  
E.g. the description for useless decoration is:

No matter how you look at it,  
this is just a useless decoration.  

there are 64 characters, so there will be 64 indexes, there is also a new line after "it," the new line is encoded as 0x8080 in 2 bytes.
This brings the total length of the index section to 66 bytes.

this is how the indexes of the description for the useless decoration looks in hex:

01 02 03 04 05 06 06 07 08 03 09 02 0A 03 0B 02  
0C 03 0D 02 02 0E 03 05 06 03 0F 06 10 11 80 80  
06 09 0F 12 03 0F 12 03 13 0C 12 06 03 05 03 0C  
12 07 0D 07 12 12 03 14 07 15 02 08 05 06 0F 02  
16 17  

This is what each index represents are a glyph:  
01 = N  
02 = o  
03 = \<space\>  
04 = m  
05 = a  
06 = t  
07 = e  
08 = r  
09 = h  
0A = w  
0B = y  
0C = u  
0D = l  
0E = k  
0F = i  
10 = ,  
11 = \<blank\>  
80 80 = \<new line\>  
12 = s  
13 = j  
14 = d  
15 = c  
16 = .  
17 = \<blank\>  

The index section ends with 00 00
  
The next section is the glyph spacing.

there are 8 header bytes of this section.  
first 4 bytes are number of glyphs.  
last 4 bytes are number of vertical pixels for each glyph. This can also be number of 16bit shorts for each glyph.  

Then the spacing information begins:  
each glyph has 1 byte representing its spacing in pixels.  
e.g. if the first byte is 08 then glyph 01 (N) will be allowed 8 pixels in width before the next glyph after it.  

Then after this section the glyph bit maps start.  
they are stored as 1-bit pixels, as rows of pixels either 0 or 1.  
0 is no pixel, 1 is a white pixel.  

e.g. the first glyph for useless decoration (representing the capital N) is:  
00 00 
00 42  
00 62 
00 62  
00 52 
00 52  
00 4A 
00 4A    
00 46 
00 46  
00 42 
00 00    

Twelve 16bits representing a single glyph.  

Breaking this down into binary makes it more easy to visualise.
